# ‚ú® Doodle Quest: AI Adventure Creator

**Turn any webpage into a fun, AI-powered adventure game!**

Doodle Quest is a Chrome Extension that uses the power of on-device AI to transform dense articles, blog posts, and stories into playful, interactive "quests." It's a visual educator designed to make learning engaging and fun for kids and adults alike.

## üöÄ About The Project

In a world saturated with information, how we learn is as important as what we learn. Doodle Quest was born from a simple question: **What if we could give every webpage an "infographic mode"?**

This extension acts as an on-the-fly game designer. It analyzes the content of any webpage and uses the Gemini Nano model to generate a unique, interactive adventure. It creates a theme, a simple summary, and a series of emoji-based "Quest Steps." But there's a twist! Some silly, out-of-place "impostors" are mixed in, and it's your job to find them, turning learning into a fun "spot the imposter" game.

### Key Features

*   **üß† Instant Adventure Generation:** Turn any article, blog, or story into a game with a single click.
*   **üéÆ Gamified Learning:** Understand complex topics through visual emoji scenes and an interactive "spot the imposter" challenge.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Adjustable Difficulty:** Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard to change the complexity of the summary and the number of quest steps.
*   **üåç Multilingual Support:** Generate adventures in English, Spanish, or Japanese.
*   **üîí 100% Private & Offline:** All AI processing happens directly on your computer using Google's on-device model. Your data never leaves your device, and it works even without an internet connection.
